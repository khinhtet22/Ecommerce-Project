# E-commerce Sales &amp; Shipping Analytics Dashboard — Power BI

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing sales, profit %, shipping efficiency, and product performance across U.S. states and regions.

Developed a star-schema data model and cleaned data in Power Query to improve accuracy and report performance.

Created KPIs for Total Sales, Profit %, Shipping Cost, and category-level profitability using DAX.

Designed a What-If analysis simulating changes in shipped quantities, demonstrating that shipping cost per unit decreases as shipment volume increases (economies of scale).

Performed basket analysis and identified cross-sell opportunities (e.g., Taste of the Wild often purchased with Memory Foam).

Analyzed shipping cost patterns by state and region (East, Central, West) to support logistics and operational decision-making.
